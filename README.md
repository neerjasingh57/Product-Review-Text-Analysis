# Product-Review-Text-Analysis 

To conduct this text analysis, I collected 50 online product reviews of Google Pixel Buds from Target, Bestbuy, Walmart, and Googleâ€™s online store. The time period of these reviews spanned from May to November of 2020. I first plotted the distribution of the ratings on a scale of 1-5. Then, to analyze the text, we counted word frequency for both the review title and reviews, clustered the reviews, and did a sentiment analysis using the reviews. 

To see the results of my analysis, take a look at my colab notebook:
